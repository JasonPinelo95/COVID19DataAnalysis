# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

This work was done as my final project for the subject of Programming in my University
I wanted to apply most of the knowledge I acquired during the second quarter, that is, applying some statistics and programming to do Data Analysis, but mostly because it will help me with my next quarter,
I took as a reference a project offered by Coursera, you can find it here https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid19-data-analysis-using-python

The motivation for this analysis is the next question:

#### Is there any relationship between the spread off the corona virus in a country and how happy people are living?

For this purpose 2 Data Sets were used: John Hopkins Coronavirus Dataset and World Happiness Report DataSet, included in this repository, but since the coronavirus data is updated everyday, you can find the newer versions here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases
I used the dataset of July 29th
